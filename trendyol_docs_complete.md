# Stock and Price Update (updatePriceAndInventory)

### Product Stock And Price Update​

The price and stock information of the products created and approved to Trendyol can be updated at the same time.

  * If you send the same request again without making any changes in the request body in the stock-price update process, an error message will be returned to you. You will see the error message "**15 dakika boyunca aynı isteği tekrarlı olarak atamazsınız!"**. You just need to fix your systems so that you can send only your changing stock-prices.
  * The stock you submit in the Quantity field is the salable stock information. Sellable stock information is updated when an order is received or restocked by you.
  * You can update a maximum of 1000 items (sku) in stock-price update transactions.



Check Batchrequest Result

After the product stock and price update process, you need to check the status of your products and the transfer process via the **[getBatchRequestResult](/en/docs/trendyol-marketplace/product-integration/check-batchrequest-result)** service with the batchRequestId in the response.

# Product Update (updateProducts)

### Product Update​

This method allows you to update the products that you have previously created using the [createProduct V2](/en/docs/trendyol-marketplace/product-integration/product-create) service in your Trendyol store.

**Limited to Product Information:**

  * This service is specifically designed for updating product information only. If you need to update stock and price values, you should use the [updatePriceAndInventory](/en/docs/trendyol-marketplace/product-integration/stock-and-price-update) service.



**Check Category and Attribute Values:**

  * As new category and category attribute values may be added, it is recommended to check the [getCategoryTree](/en/docs/trendyol-marketplace/product-integration/trendyol-category-list) and [getCategoryAttributes](/en/docs/trendyol-marketplace/product-integration/trendyol-category-attribute-list) services to ensure that the category and category attribute values you use are up-to-date before updating your products.



**Status Update:**

  * The status of the product will be set to "İçerik Kontrol Bekleniyor" (Content Check Pending) after the update request. Your products may still be open for sale. If you don't want to receive orders during this period, it's crucial to update your stock and price information accordingly.



**Maximum Items in Each Request:**

  * You can include a maximum of 1000 items in each update request.



**productMainId Constraint:**

  * Note that the productMainId value cannot be updated for approved products.



Check Batchrequest Result

  * If the package you are trying to feed with the cargo tracking number is in the status of cancelled, shipped, delivered or if the tracking code has been fed to the relevant package before, you will receive the error **"Shipment Update Edilebilir Bir Durumda Değil."**.
  * The shipping code cannot be used for packages with the status of shipped, delivered.
  * If a notification of unsupplied is made to a package whose cargo number has been updated, a new package and cargo code will be created, so it is expected that the cargo code of the new package will be updated again through the integration.

# Getting Returned Orders (getClaims)

### Getting Returned Orders​

This method enables you to retrieve information about returned orders from the Trendyol system.

**Rejected Package Information:**

  * Information about exchange packages will be available in the "replacementOutboundpackageinfo" field within the response.
  * If the customer's return request is rejected and a return rejection package has been created to be sent back, the package information will be returned to you from the **"rejectedpackageinfo"** field. If there is no return rejection package, this field will not appear.
  * The **rejectedpackageinfo.packageId** information is the id of the returned rejection package. By using this Id information, you can send with your own cargo agreement (your own cargo codes) and notify us from the [Shipping code update service.](/en/docs/trendyol-marketplace/order-integration/update-shipping-code)
  * If the return is rejected with the reasonId from [Claim issue service](/en/docs/trendyol-marketplace/returned-orders-integration/create-a-return-request) "2101" (change request from the order question (it should not be used if the customer does not have a request)), the exchange will be approved.



**Statuses and Status Updates:**

  * Available statuses for request include: Created, WaitingInAction, Accepted, Cancelled, Rejected, Unresolved, InAnalysis.
  * You can use a query similar to the following: suppliers/{supplierid}/claims?claimItemStatus=Created
  * Returned orders, with updated status in return services, will be provided to you in the order of lastModifiedDate.
  * To obtain information about new orders, you should request with the "Created" status.



**Date Information:**

  * The claimDate information is sent to you in Timestamp (milliseconds) GMT format. To match the date information with the supplier panel, you need to process as GMT + 3.



**Cargo Tracking Link:**

  * **rejectedpackageinfo.cargoTrackingLink** returns the reject claim cargo package when it is shipped. Sellers working with their own cargo agreement can control the cargo process from this field.

# Webhook Model

### Webhook Model​

With the development of webhooks, we will be able to automatically notify another application when a certain event or action occurs.

  * Instead of receiving data using the getshipmentpackage service that you use to pull your orders, a mechanism is used that sends a request to a special URL that you share, which is triggered when the event occurs, using webhooks.



### Webhook Service​

You can use webhook subscriptions to receive notifications about order events in Trendyol Seller Center.

  * "CREATED"
  * "PICKING"
  * "INVOICED"
  * "SHIPPED"
  * "CANCELLED"
  * "DELIVERED"
  * "UNDELIVERED"
  * "RETURNED"
  * "UNSUPPLIED"
  * "AWAITING"
  * "UNPACKED"
  * "AT_COLLECTION_POINT"
  * "VERIFIED"



We are providing all the status with the same service. (as a full body). Sellers should provide the webhook service with the request model below to be able to get the requested status for the order.

### Webhook Authorization​

There are 2 types of authorization method allowed which "BASIC_AUTHENTICATION" or "API_KEY". You should use one of the method while creating your webhook request in the field called "AuthenticationType".

  * If the "AuthenticationType" field is "API_KEY", the "apiKey" field is mandatory, and the "username" and "password" fields may not be sent.
    * If your service expects api key in the header, it will be sent as "x-api-key".
  * If the "AuthenticationType" field is "BASIC_AUTHENTICATION", the "username" and "password" fields are mandatory. The "apiKey" field may not be sent.



### Webhook Retry Model​

In case of an error in webhook services, the system will automatically take action and deactivate the relevant webhook request. In this context, we will send two e-mails to our sellers.

  * In the 1st e-mail, we will share information about the webhook ID that received the error and we will share with you the period during which we will continue to send requests to this service.
  * In the 2nd e-mail, we will inform you that we have reached the end of the relevant period and that the webhook ID that received the error has been deactivated.



You can activate your deactivated webhooks after fixing the problem in your service.

### Webhook Best Practices​

  * If there is any failed request made to your webhook services, Trendyol will push the failed orders every 5 minutes until it get success. (This will be changed in the future)
  * Since sending data via webhook is not always possible, it is recommended that you make improvements to receive data periodically from Trendyol via the relevant service.
    * For example, if you have created a webhook request for order data, we recommend that you synchronize your data periodically using the getshipmentpackage service.
  * Your webhook service's endpoint should not contain "Trendyol", "Dolap", "localhost".
  * The maximum number of webhooks that can be created for a seller is 15. Webhooks that are deactivated are also included in this number. If you exceed the maximum number of webhooks, you can delete the appropriate one from your existing webhooks and re-define a webhook.



### Webhook Request Model​

Currently we are only allowing sellers to use orders with the same model with the getShipmentPackages service.

  * Request type should be JSON.
  * Request METHOD should be POST.



**"createdBy" can get the values below:**

  * "order-creation" -> The package is created directly with the coming order
  * "cancel" -> The package is created after partial cancellation
  * "split" -> The package is created based on the package split
  * "transfer" -> Orders that are directed to another seller by Trendyol because the seller who received the order does not have the product.



**Trendyol will be pushing the orders according to model below;**

Currently, necessary data is provided in the service response for orders in this status. Please note that in the future, this data may not be available.When you deliver orders in this status, there might be order cancellation processes, and Trendyol explicitly states that they do not accept responsibility for such cases.
  * For canceled orders, you can use the "status=Cancelled,UnSupplied" parameter.
